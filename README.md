## 🎯 Project Overview

This project represents a real-world forensic investigation conducted on Widget Co.'s infrastructure following a suspected security breach in October 2022. Using **Splunk Enterprise** as the primary SIEM platform, our team analyzed over **10 different log sources** to identify, track, and document a sophisticated multi-stage cyberattack.

### Investigation Scope
- **Duration**: October 12-26, 2022
- **Log Sources**: 10 CSV datasets (VPN, DNS, Cloud, MFA, WidgetApp, Password Vault)
- **Platform**: Splunk Enterprise
- **Outcome**: Confirmed breach with complete attack timeline and IOCs

## 🔬 Technical Analysis

### Splunk Queries & Detection Logic

Our investigation leveraged multiple Splunk Processing Language (SPL) queries to correlate events across different data sources:

#### 1. **Phishing Detection**
```spl
index=widget_co sourcetype=dns
| search query IN ("glasslu.com", "*.glasslu.com")
| stats count by user, query, src_ip
| sort -count
```

#### 2. **MFA Bypass Identification**
```spl
index=widget_co sourcetype=mfa action="bypass"
| stats count by user, src_ip, app
| where count > 3
```

#### 3. **Brute Force Detection**
```spl
index=widget_co sourcetype=widgetapp action="failed_login"
| stats count by user, src_ip
| where count > 5
```

#### 4. **Password Vault Anomalies**
```spl
index=widget_co sourcetype=password_vault action="login"
| search src_ip="180.76.54.93"
| table _time, user, src_ip, action
```

#### 5. **Privilege Escalation Tracking**
```spl
index=widget_co (sourcetype=cloud OR sourcetype=it_admin)
| search user="DDDXUB"
| table _time, user, src_ip, action, system
```

### Data Sources Analyzed

| Source | Events Analyzed | Key Findings |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| DNS Logs | 15,000+ | Malicious domain access |
| MFA Logs | 8,500+ | Multiple bypass attempts |
| VPN Logs | 12,000+ | Suspicious IP geolocations |
| WidgetApp | 20,000+ | Brute force patterns |
| Password Vault | 3,200+ | Unauthorized access |
| Cloud Portal | 5,600+ | Privilege escalation |

## 📈 Dashboards

We created three comprehensive Splunk dashboards for real-time monitoring and incident visualization:

### Dashboard 1: Breach Correlation Dashboard
- Consolidated view of all breach-related events
- Timeline visualization of attack progression
- User activity correlation matrix

### Dashboard 2: Malicious Activity Detection
- Real-time DNS threat monitoring
- VPN geolocation analysis
- MFA bypass alerts
- Failed authentication tracking

### Dashboard 3: Executive Summary Dashboard
- High-level metrics and KPIs
- Attack vector visualization
- Impact assessment charts
- Remediation status tracker

📁 *Dashboard XML files available in `/dashboards` directory*

## 💡 Recommendations

### For IT/Security Teams (Technical)

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Account Isolation**
   - Disable accounts: BDRVLS, DDDXUB
   - Force password reset for all users
   - Review access logs for additional compromises

2. **MFA Hardening**
   - Eliminate bypass mechanisms
   - Enforce hardware token/authenticator apps
   - Remove SMS/email fallback options

3. **Endpoint Forensics**
   - Scan all devices used by compromised accounts
   - Deploy EDR solutions
   - Perform memory analysis for persistence mechanisms

#### Long-term Security Enhancements
- ✅ Implement geo-fencing for authentication
- ✅ Deploy real-time Splunk alerting for IOCs
- ✅ Enforce password rotation every 60 days
- ✅ Configure account lockout after 3 failed attempts
- ✅ Extend MFA to legacy applications

### For Leadership (Procedural)

1. **Security Awareness Training**
   - Quarterly phishing simulations
   - Mandatory cybersecurity training for all employees
   - Department-specific threat briefings

2. **Incident Response Planning**
   - Update IR playbooks for phishing scenarios
   - Define breach notification procedures
   - Establish communication protocols

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Hire dedicated SOC analyst
   - Invest in EDR/XDR solutions
   - Budget for regular security audits

4. **Access Governance**
   - Quarterly access reviews
   - Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) privileged access
   - Enforce principle of least privilege
